#### Principles of persuasion
There are a few key levers of influence which can be used to our advantage when we are trying to build a positive relationship with someone, trying to convince them to try something or want to cause a behavioural change. While these are not the only ways to do it, not using these techniques would be similar to leaving the most obvious tools in the tool shed and struggling to work with complex tools.

These principles are:
1. Unity
2. Liking
3. Reciprocation
4. Social proof
5. Authority
6. Scarcity
7. Commitment & consistency

The psychological principles to be applied need to be tailored to your motives (ethical motives)
* If you wish to ::build a better relation:: with someone, you should apply the principles of *Reciprocation, Liking and Unity*
* When you wish to ::reduce uncertainty in their minds::, work with *social proof and authority*
* When you want to ::drive action::, use the principles of *scarcity and consistency*

#### Why we use mental shortcuts
While this behaviour might seem irrational, it is very sensible given that it works out well in most cases -> in a large number of cases, the expensive product is, in fact, of a higher quality. Hence, it makes sense that this shortcut is in place as it allows us to make quick decisions at times without having to become an expert on every purchase decision.

Related to [[#Why do we use these mental shortcuts?]]

#### Expensive is good is a mental shortcut that we often encounter
One of the most frequently in play mental shortcuts is the Expensive = Good shortcut. We tend to assume that a more expensive product will perform better / is of higher quality than an inexpensive one

When the same product is shown as discounted from a higher price vs directly shown at the lower price, the probability of getting a click or buy is higher in the first case.

This is not very different to how many animals also employ mental shortcuts when taking care of their chicks (turkeys), fighting for their territory (some birds) and deciding on mates.

#### Give a reason when asking for a favour
Another mental shortcut that is commonly employed is around favours. People are a lot more likely to oblige if you give them a reason for asking the favour. In fact, this shortcut is so strong that in many cases, we don’t even need an actual reason - if someone uses the word “because”, we might be just as likely to oblige, as we would be when getting an actual reason.
This could also explain why getting a context around requests usually makes people more happy in a workplace than being ordered to do something

#### Why do we use these mental shortcuts?
We cannot process all the information about people, places, things that’s thrown at us at every moment we spend awake. The mental effort of this would be exhausting and we would barely have any energy left to process anything else.
Hence, instead we rely on these shortcuts on a large number of things on a daily basis in order to conserve energy

Related to [[#Why we use mental shortcuts]]

#### Safety net for mental shortcuts
While we constantly rely on shortcuts to speed up decision making, we also tend to use more than one cue to act on something.
Many times, we also rely on other shortcuts such as expert opinions in order to reach a decision.
Again, while this reliance on experts might work out in most cases, there might be some disastrous consequences at times when things go wrong

#### Reliance on shortcuts changes with stakes
The higher the stakes for you personally in a given situation, the more attention you will pay to the different aspects of the problem.
They are more likely to respond in a controlled and thoughtful manner when they have the desire and the ability to carefully analyse the situation
If you are not directly affected by it or if it has no impact on your immediate or future well being, you are much more likely to rely on expert advice or other shortcuts when making a decision

#### Pace of modern world and mental shortcuts
With the steep increase in the number of stimuli we receive on a daily basis in the Information Age, we are much more likely to rely on shortcuts to make our decisions as we experience higher mental fatigue or the issue might be extremely complex or the emotional response too high.
This is only likely to increase as we go ahead and the number of stimuli continue to increase

#### Mimics are present all around us
Mimics are the organisms which copy the behavioural patterns of one species / cell in order to trick them into the automated or instinctive response.
This is present in some fireflies, and even in some viruses and bacteria. These single celled organisms imitate the behaviour of certain proteins or other molecules in order to avoid detection by the body’s defence mechanisms.
Humans are no different - human mimics try to imitate the behaviour which would trigger the right mental shortcuts instead

#### The contrast principle
Another psychological pattern of ours, we tend to look at things always in contrast to one another and in a relative sense.
If you lift a heavy object after having lifted a light one, it’ll feel heavier than it actually is. This same principle can possibly be applied to studying as well.
If you spend the first half of your day watching shows and videos, it would be much harder to get yourself to focus on the dull and drab exercise that is reading.

We’ve all used contrast principle in our lives without even really knowing what is being employed. This technique is so common and yet so subtle that it could leave us wondering what really happened, as we stand there holding purchases that we did not really intend to make, but are now holding in our hands.
Salespeople tend to use this technique often where they might show a few expensive items before bringing you to the medium price ones, or realtors might show a few garbage properties before showing the “right property”

#### Fixed action patterns
The mental shortcuts referred to throughout are called fixed action patterns. These are the fixed actions that we take when we see a trigger feature and this is not very different between humans and other organisms.  

#### Trigger features
The single stimulus or feature in an animal / action / situation which trigger [[#Fixed action patterns]] is called a trigger feature

These are basically what are referred to as cues in habit theory

#### Reciprocation is a strong driving force
Reciprocation is a big driver of behaviour. It has been an integral part of the human evolution when humans had to trust each other in order to share resources, knowledge, and food. This made humans one of the first species to share their resources.
When someone received something, it sort of obligated them to repay this kindness in the future. This is such a central aspect of our cultures that in many languages, the word for “thank you” is literally “obliged”

#### Reciprocation at the workplace
Small acts of kindness at the workplace also have a lasting impact on the teams. If a boss demonstrates to his or her employees that they care for them (through action), the employees are much more likely to stick around and maybe even feel bad to leave

#### Why does reciprocation work?
Human societies are conditioned in a way to demonstrate reciprocation and all of us are taught this from when we are really young. As a practice, most societies and most of us also hate freeloaders - people who will receive a favour without repaying it back over time.
[[#Reciprocation is an overpowering factor]] in the lives of a lot of us

#### Reciprocation is an overpowering factor
Reciprocation is a very strong driving force behind behaviour and is also likely to override whether or not a person likes you.
Regan’s experiments have found that while people are likely to base their decisions in general on how much they like you (probably a shortcut/ [[#Fixed action patterns]] ), if you do them a favour, reciprocation overrides this and becomes the key driver behind behaviour.

#### Do not minimise a favour you did for someone
If you do a favour for someone and then minimise it by saying something like “don’t worry about it”, you are most likely going to lose the effect of that favour. You are telling the person to not worry about the favour itself.
Instead, say something along the lines of “I’m sure you would’ve done the same for me, if our roles were reversed”!

#### A gift at the start vs the end
Many companies have noticed that it is beneficial (in more than one ways) to offer a gift at the start of a survey or when entering the store than it is to give a much larger gift at the end of it.
Customers are more likely to spend higher in cases where they received something when entering. Additionally, a much smaller gift (\$5) at the start was more enforcing than a big gift at the end (\$50)

#### Reciprocation and politics
Politics is based on the entire principle of give and take where everyone is doing someone a favour in the hope of getting it returned sometime in the future. Looking at the US, this also partly explains why some of the “Washington outsider” presidents had a much harder time getting legislation passed - no one owed them anything.
Same goes for [[#Campaign contributions in politics]]

#### Campaign contributions in politics
No matter how much companies and politicians might claim that their behaviour is independent of campaign funding, they are definitely more likely to get a request from a funder passed than that of someone who did not fund them.

Politicians are not less susceptible to [[#Fixed action patterns]] than the rest of us

#### Reciprocity vs Never back down
The best example of contrast between the two approaches is from the Cold War, when Kennedy and Khrushchev had to agree to mutually remove their nuclear weapons from Turkey/Italy and Cubs respectively to bring down the tensions
Had they taken a “I won’t back down” stance here, we probably would’ve had the 3rd world war by now.
This was, however, publicised as an event of not backing down in the US (and probably Russia) as the leaders did not want to demonstrate that they were conceding ground to the other

#### Problem freed > Problem free
Many times, we see companies trying to predict what some problems their customers might face and try to solve them in advance.

This is not always the best way forward, as the company might now be limiting their own ability to “help solve a problem” of their clients, which would have bought them more goodwill. This is especially true in the service industry, where helping the client out with their specific need of the hour would have given a lot of trust + potentially business due to  [[#Enhancing reciprocity]]

#### Enhancing reciprocity
We can get people to reciprocate our favours by helping them out a little. However, this can also be supercharged if you put in some thought and effort into the favour you are doing for someone

If the gift you are giving to someone solves their need of the hour or is something highly customised, they are much more likely to feel the urge to reciprocate.

#### Illusion of choice with reciprocity
When we receive an unasked gift, we are stuck between a rock and a hard place. It is generally unacceptable to even reject a gift because someone has spent their effort and money into getting the gift for you.
And once you accept the gift, you have the feeling of reciprocity nagging you to help them out.

#### Group sentiment of reciprocity

Reciprocity works not just as a individual to individual thing but also as a group. If someone helps us and we are unable to directly help them, we’ll try to find ways to help out the person’s family or friends.
On the flip side, if someone hurts us, we will look for ways to hurt their family or someone they care about, in order to exact revenge.

#### Gift giving / favours are not always equal or symmetric

Favours and reciprocated actions are usually asymmetrical. Given anyone can choose the first favour they want to do  [[#Illusion of choice with reciprocity]] , people can choose to do a small favour for you and ask for something big in return.
We could always choose to ignore reciprocating the act, but we could end up being  [[#social alienation and reciprocation]]

#### Social alienation and reciprocation
Reciprocation is wound strongly into our social fabric and anyone who does not abide by the principles is usually treated as an outcast.
There are a couple of reasons for this:
1. Rejection leads to the breaking of one chain with a given set of people
2. Rejection could change the other person’s mind, causing them to not bother with helping out others later

#### Drinks at a bar for women
While seemingly harmless, accepting free drinks at a bar can often send signals to everyone around that someone is more sexually available through the [[#Social alienation and reciprocation]]  norms
The same would, ideally, go with paying for the dinner on dates. This could be one of the driving forces behind the  [[#Split the bill, always]] ideology in feminism.

#### Reciprocation in long term relations
In longer term relations, reciprocity does not work on a 1:1 basis, but is usually just checked in the long term on whether or not people are helping out both ways approximately equally

#### Adjustment is also bound by reciprocity

Adjusting or making concessions are also reciprocated, typically, in the society as we tend to exchange concessions in our daily dealings. [[#Adjusting is beneficial for the growth of society]]  and is woven into our social fabric similar to reciprocation of favours or gift giving ( [[#Social alienation and reciprocation]] )
A great example of this is in  [[#Reciprocity vs Never back down]] .

#### Adjusting is beneficial for the growth of society

When we make some concessions, we go into it with the assumption that the other person will reciprocate. This is, again, part of our general thinking as a society. If we do not trust the other person will reciprocate a concession, no one would take the first step and an agreement can never be reached; an exchange never made. 

When concessions are not made by both parties or when one party feels it has been taken for a ride in the exchange, it leads to further repercussions as it could cause a rift.

#### Counteroffers are an effective negotiation tactic, when used correctly

When we reject an initial offer, and are then presented with a revised offer for a smaller request, we tend to comply with it. The more tactfully this is presented, the higher the chance for our compliance.

A large number of real world negotiations are based on this principle, as we commonly see people including impossible clauses into negotiations only to remove them later ( [[#Adjustment is also bound by reciprocity]] )

#### Reject, then, retreat works like a charm

We can get someone to comply with an objectively big request when it follows a (bigger) rejected request.  [[#This rejected request, however, should not be outrageous]]

#### This rejected request, however, should not be outrageous

While we need to prefix our reasonably large request with a slightly bigger request in order to work the charm of *Reject-then-retreat* ( [[#Reject, then, retreat works like a charm]] ), we need to be careful not to present an outrageous request first.
The rejected request should be something that still keeps us reasonable. If we go with a ridiculous offer, we will not be considered reasonable / sensible and will have our offer rejected (both of them)

#### Reject then retreat typically incorporates two principles

In addition to the reciprocation that it begets, this approach typically also includes [[#The contrast principle]]
When someone drops their ask vs their previous, much more grand requests, we do not look at the new requests objectively but are always looking at it relatively 

#### Reject then retreat does not seem to breed any resentment

Widely, there is no resentment that people harbour towards someone engaging in this tactic. In fact, on the contrary, they tend to be much more diligent in following through on the request and open to any new ideas or further help by the same person.

It is likely that this is due to the concession being made by the requester in the first place ( [[#Reject, then, retreat works like a charm]]), as long as it is not seen as an obvious trick ( [[#This rejected request, however, should not be outrageous]] )

#### Positive outcomes of reject then retreat

It causes a greater sense of responsibility and a feeling of satisfaction in the person complying with the request.


#### Friendship is a strong relation that businesses try to exploit, linked to the liking principle - Pg 73
* Friendship is a strong ally for businesses to exploit, which is linked to the Liking principle. We all like our friends and are going to listen to what they tell us
	
#### How companies make use of the liking principle - Pg 78
* Companies have been exploiting this principle of liking for improving their sales for years now, with Tupperware and many other organisations getting people from the neighbourhood to sell to their friends. Charities also try and take advantage of this rule to get more donations
* More interestingly, getting referred by a friend for some sales pitch is almost as strong as directly buying from them
	* Companies can also use this as sort of a new pyramid scheme where they can ask each of their benefactors to suggest some friends of theirs who would be interested in the product. 
	* When they now go to make a sale to this friend, they can always give the reference of the first person and boom, they have an in!
	* We typically do not ask someone to leave if we know a friend has recommended them to us

#### Quick and sure fire ways to be a good salesperson - Pg 82
* For someone to be a successful salesperson, the formula is actually very simple - offer a reasonable price and be someone that people like. 
	* The first part here is actually the easier one as it involves just understanding how to price your product
	* The second part is where things get tricky as we need to change ourselves a little and there are factors that are not in our control

#### Attractiveness and liking - Pg 83
* Attractive people are generally well liked and are usually perceived to be more intelligent, nicer, kinder and thoughtful than the unattractive ones 
* The ::Halo Effect:: is in play here as one good feature overshadows the others and causes us to believe that the other factors are good as well ( that is, because this person is good at X, they must be at Y Z A and B)
* This plays a part in all our decisions including politics, work and relationships

#### Similarity is another way we can get people to like us - Pg 84
* Another common “compliance artist” trick is similarity, which also begets liking. We tend to like people who are similar to us, have similar interests or prefer similar things
* When dating online, your two best bets would be to either be attractive or to be similar to a lot of people
* For the compliance artists, even if they aren’t actually similar, they can claim to be, and get away with better returns from you than they would otherwise

#### How companies target us on Social media - Pg 88
* On social media, companies try to use language that their key target segment is using as it allows them to connect better and come off as similar. This is a key part of the social media personality that these companies build

#### We tend to look at differences naturally than similarities - Pg 88
* As a race, humans tend to pay more attention to the differences than the similarities between one another.
	* This is the same when we compare objects as well, where we tend to look at those one or two differences between objects and ignore everything else that’s the same
	* This also probably explains why when we are looking at say mobiles and we “compare products”, we skim through the 100 features that are similar but what registers with us are those 2 differences between the products
	* When we are negotiating or even just conversing with someone, the similarities are right there to be discussed and yet, we tend to focus on what makes us different; talking about similarities has a better chance of getting someone to like you

#### Rewards in the brain for getting “Liked” - Pg 90
* When we receive a lot of likes on our social media posts, the same reward sectors light up as when winning a lot of money or eating chocolate 

#### Flattery can often get a person to like us - Pg 90
* While we claim to be extremely rational people, we are very easily fooled by flattery and tend to like the people that flatter us. The same holds true for people who claim to like us
* The same holds true even when there is absolutely no truth associated with the praise - we have a mental shortcut that automatically triggers and we’re happy to receive the praise 

#### Real praise works just as well as flattery and could be a little better - Pg 90
* While false praise works, this means honest praise works just as well and maybe a little better. And this is where the point from How to Win friends comes in - be hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise

#### Praising a superior without coming off as a suck up - Pg 92
* We can also praise our bosses and others that are superior to us without seeming like a suck up 
	* If you find something really interesting or good about what your boss has done, then calling it out and telling them or others behind their back about how good it was will go a long way towards earning good will

#### Get someone to continue doing well at something - Pg 92, 94
* A second way that flattery helps is when you want someone to continue what they’re doing well - here, while the compliments would be genuine, they would also motivate the person to keep at it because they now know a sure-fire way to get praise - our brains are suckers for rewards and this is a simple way to light up the reward system
* Genuine flattery (that is, flattery on a true quality) has a really good impact on the person’s behaviour. If someone is good at ownership at work and you praise them for it, they’re more likely to take up even more ownership of the tasks they are assigned
	

#### Familiarity breeds liking - Pg 96
* Familiarity breeds liking. When we see the same image multiple times, we are more likely to like the person or thing that’s in them 
	* “Repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth” - Joseph Goebbels
	* Probably one reason why fake news is so effective is the magnitude at which it is shared 
		* Two factors would be coming into play here - familiarity and social approval 
		* If so many people like it or have retweeted something, it must be true
		* Also explains why these messages come with the action step of forwarding to your friends - you’re employing the first tactic of getting a friend to share it and you’re sharing the same message multiple times for familiarity 
	
#### Familiarity in the wrong setting, however, can breed resentment
* Familiarity (repeated exposure) in the wrong setting, however, is more likely to breed resentment and conflict
	* This is especially true with competitive environments where we are more likely to start to resent those competing with us through familiarity 
	* An example of this is how Eric Forman reacts to running into the guy who hit on Donna in That 70s Show
#### Creating an Us vs Them mentality usually tends to breed resentment and hatred towards the other group - pg 99
* While the header seems very serious (and it is), hatred here could be more of a general dislike. However, when that is consistently present for a long time, it could turn into hatred
	* This is when we work against another group for any set of tasks
	* Same holds true for people competing for the same promotion or for the affection of the same person and even when it’s for the same piece of bread
	* We tend to focus on the differences rather than the similarities
* When we work together with another set of people, we start to see the similarities and might even end up liking the same person, over time
	* This is true when we see success on the task we worked together on

#### Cooperation can also improve liking and this is also another technique frequently used by compliance professionals - pg 104
* If someone is willing to be on our side and put forward a mutual problem, then we tend to like the person more and listen to what they have to say
* This is used by sales people, interrogation specialists and a host of other people

#### Our brains work by association and when we hear bad news from someone, we have negative feelings about them. The reverse also holds true - pg 107 - 114
* “Do not shoot the messenger” arises from this same concept - that we should not associate the message with the messenger themselves
	* The reverse of Halo effect - Horns effect - happens in such cases where if you’re the bearer of bad news, just about everything else now will taken in a negative light
* This is the reason we have a lot of celebrity endorsements and good looking people modelling for products - companies are trying to get us to associate their product with success or attractiveness 
* This same principle holds true for brands, mere words and everything in between 
* When we have a positive experience with a brand or tool, we associate everything related to it as being positive and the inverse
* A “sale” is immediately taken up as a positive thing because we expect to buy things for cheaper than they actually are, even when there is no real discounting in place
* Even politicians try to associate themselves with the people that they think will add the most value to their campaign
	* This could be actors, business people, sports stars or anyone else
	* Depending on the kind of association they wish to generate, they pick the right celebrity for this 


### Fleeting notes

#### Do attractive people have to put in lesser efforts when reciprocating
* On my point about “do attractive people  get away easily with not reciprocating”, Liking could also be a factor for this. 
	* One is the possibility that they are generally liked more
	* Another is that because more people want to like / be liked by attractive people, this could be happening
This is from notes on [[#Social alienation and reciprocation]] [[#Attractiveness and liking - Pg 83]]

#### Split the bill, always
This concept / simple action in feminism could stem from the fact that someone else paying for your bill sort of obliged women to “repay” this “kindness” through sex.
This stems from the notes on  [[#Drinks at a bar for women]] & [[#Social alienation and reciprocation]] 

#### Do companies give out referral bonuses through the LIKING principle?
* ==Is this why companies give referral bonuses==? While it is an incentive for people to recommend people, it is also an incentive for the person taking the referral to join 
* Also, this could easily be the case for referral amounts that are handed out to users for onboarding a friend (Does bear have any referral benefits lol)
This stems from the notes on [[#Friendship is a strong relation that businesses try to exploit, linked to the liking principle - Pg 73]]

#### How do chances of getting a match change with the same profile except the interests and bio are different?
* Would be interesting to run a test on how your success rate in getting a match changes based on this
* Example: put on TSwift as favourite artist instead of Beatles or the dead and see if the rate of matches is higher
* In the world of online dating, is it better to be an average of a lot of people than to be unique, as you’ll then have the advantage of similarity? Obviously this is only if you aren’t particularly attractive 

This stems from a mix of [[#Attractiveness and liking - Pg 83]] and [[#Similarity is another way we can get people to like us - Pg 84]]

#### Ratings and reviews are based in psychology
* The entire system of ratings and reviews seems to hinge on some principles of psychology
* While they are important for determining bonuses and raises, those are effectively rewards designed to motivate you 

This stems from [[#Get someone to continue doing well at something - Pg 92, 94]]

#### Companies try to get their products familiarised with the public at the time of launch
* This explains why companies buy up ad space heavily when launching a new product - so they can get this unfamiliar thing out there and in people’s eyes multiple times
	
This stems from [[#Familiarity breeds liking - Pg 96]]

#### Do pop songs tend to stick to a “formula that works” because it would be something that people are familiar with?
* Can this also be one reason why pop songs tend to sound similar to one another? Because they’re trying to stick to a formula , but they’re also playing on the psychological principle 

 This stems from [[#Familiarity breeds liking - Pg 96]]

#### How do groups that have a certain amount of dislike behave when the task they are doing is a failure?
What happens when the task is a failure? Do we go back to blaming the other group for their incompetence or some other reason? Or do we still see the same united front develop?

This stems from [[#Creating an Us vs Them mentality usually tends to breed resentment and hatred towards the other group - pg 99]]
