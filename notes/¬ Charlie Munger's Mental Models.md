### Literature Notes
* You need to have a LOT of mental models, and learn how to use them at the right time in order to process the whole worldly information that is thrown at you every second of every minute

#### Swiss Army Knife
* We need to have more than one tool to deal with the complexities and nuances around us in this world
* We need to learn constantly and apply these different “tools” at the right time
* The above introduction is actually a good description for this
* “To the man with a hammer, every problem looks like a nail”
* If you do not learn of new models / ways of thinking, you will try to fit everything around you - all the problems - into the models that you know

#### The Pareto Principle
* Might not be a Munger model
* You need to put in 20% of the total effort required on something to get 80% of the result
* This is also demonstrated in the video itself as a Munger saying - You do not need to learn all the models; a few of the models carry most of the freight

#### Make friends with the eminent dead
* Some of the best people who walked the planet are already dead
* While most of these people cannot directly help us today, as there is no way to learn from them, there are the written works of large groups of people still available
* Gain knowledge from any medium possible and try to assimilate knowledge
* It is always easier to try and learn what someone else has already figured out than trying to come up with the same thing ourselves
* Study and learn about the people you admire, but also learn about where they are coming from, so you can understand and separate their biases
	* All of us are biased in one way or another, and it is always good to try and remove the inherent biases that are present in any reading, as we will already be overlaying the reading with our own biases
* [[Poor Charlie’s Almanack]] -> Munger’s writing
* While it is important to consume knowledge, it is also important to remember where you are getting the knowledge from 

#### Invert, always invert
* It is usually easier to keep track of what is it that you can do to really mess up a situation - think of these, and try to avoid them
* It is very difficult to think about how to have a good marriage, but it is much easier to think about how to ruin a marriage. Think of it, and then avoid what is it that leads to a ruined marriage
> “It is remarkable how much long term advantage people like us (Munger and Buffet) have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent” 
\- Charlie Munger

#### Compounding
* Your money grows exponentially if you just let it be (stay invested) and do not do something really stupid
* This also holds true for other aspects of life, other than investing as well. You invest in relations, in your health, in your habits. This is what is also partly there in [[¬ James Clear - Atomic Habits (2018)|Atomic Habits]]
* For this to work again, you need to think about “what to avoid”. So, invert again

#### Crush your cherished beliefs
* We hold onto our ideas and beliefs, no matter what the reality is, and this is harmful
* It is always important to remember to learn and understand beliefs that represent the reality, especially if we do not like it
* “Faced with the choice between changing ones mind and proving there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy on the proof” - John Kenneth Galbraith
* Consider all these models and all of our other beliefs to be tools in a toolbox, and we need to keep upgrading them, if needed
* Many times, we will come across newer tools and beliefs that are bound to shake us to our core and change our entire perspective of reality
	* In these situations, think of it as a retooling exercise and stay open to new ideas and models
* “You must strive to crush your most cherished belief” - Charles Darwin
	* He wrote down any new discoveries or learnings which went again his general beliefs within the first 30 mins, as the mind starts to default to the biases after a point
	
#### Opportunity costs
* Resources are not infinite, and every choice of ours comes at the cost of a lot of other options that were available to us, which we chose not to invest in
* This is related to resource swaps as well that I noted about yesterday
* This, like some of the models above, is also applicable to all the different areas in life
* It is, however, important to remember that we should not overdo this and calculate opportunity costs at every point
* We need to find a satisfactory enough solution through this model
* When there are obvious “measuring sticks” in the situation, evaluating opportunity costs becomes easier
* Measuring stick here refers to the highest possible baseline value that we can take to map everything else against
	* Basically, always compare the new opportunity against the best one you have in front of you
* When you make the wrong decision, you typically lose not just what is already lost, but also what you could have gained

#### Parimutual or Pool betting
* In this betting, the odds are dependent on the people who bet on the horses. Everyone bets against whatever they want to, and the winners will all split the winnings - the odds are not being defined explicitly by the organisers here
* Stock market is not really different from this - you get smaller odds on safer , better stocks (stocks which belong to strong companies)
* For everything around us, there is a quality and a price, and the idea is to get more quality than price on each purchase
* Look for the mispriced gambles

#### Survival of the fittest
* You do not need to be the strongest in order to survive; instead, you need to survive, and evolve in order to occupy a niche where you can survive - you need to “fit” the ecology
* Look for the areas with 0 to little competition, as this is where you could probably find these niches

#### Margin of safety
* Only make a deal on something where you are getting a better value than what the intrinsic value is
* All estimates on valuation are estimations and it is good to have that buffer
* This is true especially when doing design thinking and designing in general, where you would ideally want to include some amount of margin of safety in terms of design choices, as there are a hundred different behaviours of users that you cannot predict
* All cleverly designed systems /the ones that last the test of time/ need to have a margin of safety

#### Superpower of incentives
* Always think about the incentives for all the stakeholders involved and how these can be changed or modified in order to cause the behavioural change that you are aiming for
* When you change the incentive, people will change their behaviour for this
* People will always look out for their own interests & will try to game this system, so your incentives need to be designed accordingly
* Almost all reports from Management consulting firms tend to have recommendations for more projects that need to be done, as that is what will get them more business

#### Independent Thinking
* Think for yourself - do not blindly go with what is being said around you
* Do not take advice from a professional where the advisor has an incentive involved from the outcome
	* This is one big reason why consultants should not asked whether another project is necessary - they would always find a reason why you should give them another project
* When you think for yourself and do not go with what everyone else is saying, then you might also find some “mispriced gambles”
* EBITDA is not a great metric (while it is still a fairly decent metric) for measuring the financial health as it ignores depreciation - this is one of the worst kinds of cost as it also comes with an opportunity cost
	* Depreciation is taken on assets mainly that are owned by a business, and when you ignore this key cost, then you are also ignoring the fact that this money could very well have been spent on something else
	
#### Simplicity
* Many times in life and investing, you do not need to make the complex decision - there is no additional score that you are awarded just because you solved a complex problem
* Rule for life:
	* Take a simple basic idea
	* Take it very seriously
* This can be applied to just about everything in life, including health, relations, note taking, everything. Just because someone is saying something does not mean you need to do it that way - think independently

#### Technology as a problem
* New technologies are typically much harder to predict (even more than the other predictions)
* Many times, it is the uncertainty around the different aspects that makes these predictions so much harder to make. For example, with a Covid scenario, it is extremely difficult to make predictions on the revenues, and what we are always trying to do in these cases is to find a more predictable metric (which is the stay revenue)

#### The World’s most intelligent question
* Always ask WHY for anything - it helps us to figure why something is happening or not happening
* We tend to throw out the outliers in statistics, but this is where we can find some of the most interesting observations - these are the ones which will mostly help us understand the reality better
