Think about how you were as a kid when dealing with kids
We always tend to judge kids by our own standards, often forgetting that they’re literally just kids. When I think about it, Sandeep is in the same age as I was when I first came to Bina and stayed in Betwa. In fact, he’s a couple of years younger

And yet, sometimes I argue with him and treat him like he’s the same age as me. It is important to ensure I do not talk to him in a way that he will go out and do in the world. It is important to ensure that what he picks up from me is not going to turn him into an asshole in the future. 

This is also something that our parents tend to do, at times. Half the times, we’re young and naive and need to be told everything. However, the other half of the time, we’re expected to be as mature as them and this just does not work.

What are the principles that are driving such a behaviour? Is it mostly just projection? 

Do we really ever look at another person with an objective set of eyes or are we always just projecting our own insecurities, ambitions and ideas on them?
