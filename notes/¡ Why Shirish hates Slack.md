Keeping aside the points on habits, and what someone is used to, another factor could be the way he and other leaders access the platform. Most of them take their calls and spend their day on the phone, and would also be working from their phone, so a mobile first experience would be a priority.

The reason someone like me would prefer Slack is because of its keyboard shortcuts and other such features, which are very convenient on a laptop / PC but not on a mobile device. Hence, any platform which is limited on the desktop experience (i.e., WhatsApp) becomes a challenge for us to use, and vice versa for the leaders - especially if they are used to the mobile-first experience
