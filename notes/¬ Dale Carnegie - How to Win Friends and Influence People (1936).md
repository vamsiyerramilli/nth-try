### Literature Notes
#### Ask for a favour, when you want to gain someone’s trust
While this goes against the established principles of helping someone in order to gain their trust, [[Dale Carnegie]] says that a good way to earn someone’s trust is to ask for their help instead. 

#### When we criticise a person, we only put them on the defensive
Criticising a person only puts them on the defensive, hurts their pride, and leads to them trying to justify their behaviour. Every person tries to justify their own behaviour, and will fully believe that their actions are justified.

With criticism, we are only hurting their pride and feeling of self importance, which also arouses resentment, and will not help correct the situation itself. This resentment could also demoralise everyone else involved, and does nothing to rectify the situation itself.

The resentment that criticism engenders can demoralise everyone around, in addition to the person being criticised, and still not correct the situation itself


#### Rewarding good behaviour works much better than condemning bad behaviour
When a mechanic messed up the fuelling of an aircraft, the aircraft almost went down and the pilot could only save it through his talent. In response (when the mechanic was sure his head would be bitten off), the pilot walked up to him and asked him to fuel his aircraft for the next day as well, as he was certain the mechanic understood his error and would not make the same mistake again

If a person in this situation - a literal life and death situation - could keep his cool, then it is important that all of us remember this in our day to day behaviour

#### Humans are creatures of prejudice and vanity, not logic and reason, as we tend to believe
When dealing with people, we need to keep in mind that we are NOT dealing with creatures of “logic”. We are dealing with creatures of emotions, bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity

#### Understand people and where they are coming from, instead of criticising them
When we try to understand people instead of criticising them, and try to figure out why they are doing what they are doing, we often tend to get sympathy, tolerance and kindness from them.

#### People crave importance almost as much as they crave food
People crave the feeling of being important, and will go to a variety of lengths to get this feeling. They build big homes, buy fancy products, and try to get their names on buildings and charities.

Some people, with no other affliction, may go clinically insane trying to fulfil this need for importance, construct a dream world from which they derive their sense of importance.

#### Charles Schwab was the first person to earn a million dollars a year
> *There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticism from superiors. I never criticise anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loathe to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.* 
 \- Charles Schwab

#### We treat the “tangibles” and non-tangibles differently in our society
When someone asks for food or even money, we usually part ways with it fairly easily, if we judge that the other person is in a need of the resource. However, the same does not hold true for the more intangible cravings that people might have, such as the “need to be appreciated” or a simple (but genuine) “thank you”.

#### Appreciation is not the same as flattery
While flattery is counterfeit and in the long run, will do more harm than good, appreciation comes from the heart, while flattery comes from the teeth. Flattery is usually selfish while appreciation is unselfish

 If all we had to do was flatter, everybody would catch on and be an expert on human relations

We spend about 95% of our free time thinking about ourselves. If we spend some part of this thinking of another person’s good, we would not have to resort to flattery



### Fleeting notes
#### How asking for someone’s help is a good way to gain trust
One potential reason for this also is that when you do a favour for someone, you are more likely to remember the person favourably, as we do not do a lot of favours for people we dislike
