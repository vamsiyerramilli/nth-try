### Literature Notes
#### Steps to a habit (Pg 9)
* There are 4 steps to any habit - cue, craving, response, reward

#### Compounding of marginal improvements (Pg 15)
* While marginal improvements are not noticeable or notable, they accumulate over time to lead to big changes
* We usually tend to look out for the big changes - massive success requires massive action - which rarely comes 
#### Why habits are difficult to build or break? (Pg 17)
* Slow pace of transformation makes it hard to build good habits and easy to let bad habits slide
* Writing a few pages for one day does not bring your book into existence, working out for a few days a week does not transform you and talking to your friends a few times isn’t going to turn around your relation with them 
* Similarly, binging on YouTube for one day won’t really set you back, working late for a single day is always acceptable and pushing a project off for later once won’t hurt our prospects
* While making a 1% better decision seems insignificant at the moment, over time, it compounds 
#### Outcomes are a lagging measure of habits (Pg 18)
* Outcomes are a “lagging measure” of our current habits
* Future weight is dependent on current eating habits. Future wealth is dependent on current spending habits. Future knowledge on current learning habits -> this relates very well to the points I had yesterday on resources in life
#### Negativity also compounds (Pg 19)
* Negativity compounds; if we keep thinking of ourselves as ugly, worthless or stupid, we start interpreting life that way. The same holds for how we see others - this is why it is important to spend a few moments a day, every day, to note down something positive about others (How to win friends)
#### Impact of changes is not linear. It is similar to that of latent energy (Pg 20, 21)
* We expect the impact of our changes to habits to be linear and get irritated and dejected when that doesn’t happen. However, habits do not cause changes in a linear fashion. Instead, they work similar to the principle of latent energy in melting and boiling where the heat is stored in the body for some time and we do not see any change in the state, and then all of a sudden, it starts to melt/boil
* The reason it is so hard to build habits is because we do not see the benefits immediately - we might go to the gym for a month but see no transformation and boom, back to eating a pizza for dinner every day
#### Have a proper system and design these to help you achieve your goals (Pg 23)
* Forget goals and trust the systems
* A goal is what we want to achieve; the system is how we want to work towards this goal
* Completely ignore the goal and solely focus on the systems
#### Why are systems better than goals (Pg 24)
* Systems are better than goals for a few reasons
* Winners and losers in a race have the same goal - they probably just have different systems
* Achieving a goal is a momentary change, but a system in place is a continuous process; this is similar to the Execute phase in Essentialism, where the idea is to have a system which helps jus to quickly rely on the system to help make decisions
* Goals restrict our happiness till the point we’ve actually achieved them
* Goals hinder long term growth as we tend to fall back to our old habits once the goal is achieved		
#### Behavioural change should ideally start with the identity (Pg 30)
* There are three layers to any behaviour - identity, process, outcome 
* Most of the changes we plan to make are usually focused on the outcomes part of it, as we try to focus on what we are trying to achieve and what we’ll get out of it. “I want to write a book as it’ll help me with being more popular and getting a GMAT seat as this will count as extra curricular”
* The other kind of behavioural change goes the other way - starts with changing the identity, changing what we believe in. We focus on who we wish to become
#### Behaviours are linked to our beliefs which we hold close to our heart (Pg 32)
* Behind every system of actions, there is a set of beliefs driving the behaviour. This holds true for governments, societies, organisations and individuals. 
* We follow certain behaviours because of a given set of beliefs. When the beliefs change, the general behaviour almost invariably changes 
* Behaviour that is incongruent with our identity or beliefs will not last
* When we want to change a behaviour of ours, it is more important to change the part of our identity that is driving that behaviour 
#### Why a negative image of yourself tends to reinforce your beliefs (Pg 35)
* When we tell ourselves stories about what we are, we are non-consciously telling ourselves what we are (what we believe ourselves to be)
* With time, we change our actions to fit this new image that we’ve created of ourselves so it’s consistent 
#### Long term or continued failure at any particular habit is mainly driven by our beliefs (Pg 36)
* While failing on one single day could be due to any number of reasons, failure to change a habit in the long run is mainly due to our beliefs
* This also holds true for organisations. Organisations cultivate an identity and their future actions will always be in accordance to this identity. This is what is called “company culture”

#### Crush your old beliefs that no longer hold true (Pg 36)
* In order to constantly improve ourselves, we should never get too attached to any beliefs about ourself and constantly improve upon them. Crush your old beliefs if they no longer hold true
#### Identity and habits work in a feedback loop  (Pg 37, 38)
* Identity as formed when we provide ourselves with sufficient evidence that we “are” something. When we read every day, we start to consider ourself a reader. When we write everyday, we start to consider ourselves a writer, after doing it consistently for a reasonable amount of time
* Every time we do an action, we are adding some more fuel into a belief that we are something. Doing it consistently provides enough evidence for us to believe that we’ve finally become the thing. 
* Every small action towards something we believe in is a vote in that direction. This is how small steps add up and how behaviour compounds into lasting change
#### How do we go about changing our identity (Pg 39)
* Changing our identity is a 2 step process, which might seem simple
	* Decide what type of a person you want to be
	* Start working towards that personality with small habits and proving to yourself over time
* For identity, we need to understand 
	* What do you stand for
	* What are your principles and values
	* Who do you wish to become
* This framework gives us some good checkpoints throughout our habit-building period as we can always fall back to the question “would the person we want to become do this” when faced with the decision
* This whole process is a loop as our identity is what shapes our habits and are habits are what shape our identity 
#### Why does our brain build habits? (Pg 44 - 46)
* Our brain builds habits to conserve energy. Conscious activity in the brain is very taxing and is limited; we can only focus on a single conscious activity at a given time, which severely limits what we can accomplish 
* To make up for this limitation, our brain builds habits which are mental shortcuts which improve the efficiency of action. When the brain sees a cue which it has seen in the past, it skips the process of deciding how or where to do a task and automatically triggers the action based on past experience 
* This allows us to be free to focus our conscious mind on other important tasks at hand and not spend an inordinate amount of time shuffling between tasks
#### Habit forming is a 4 step process (Pg 47 - 49)
* There are 4 steps to any habit, which our brain runs through in order to do a task and get the reward - cue, craving, response and reward. 
* Cue is what indicates to us that a habit loop needs to be triggered
* Craving is what we want to get out of the action; when we get bored (cue), we want to be entertained (craving). Here, the response then becomes switching on YouTube 
* Response is the action that we do in order to satiate our craving
* Reward is the feeling of satisfaction of craving, which is what we were working towards
	* There are two main rewards that our brain expects - either a satisfaction from the action itself or some form of learning which will help us in the future
	* Here, learning for the brain is a reward detection mechanism - it checks whether a particular behaviour triggered a happy feeling or a negative feeling and provides the necessary feedback
#### Why do we build habits (Pg 51)
* The purpose of each habit is rather simple - it’s to solve a problem that you’re facing. You’re facing a problem when you either want something (craving) or want to alleviate some pain (also craving). You’re in the problem phase when figuring out the cue and experience craving
#### Questions to ask ourselves when building habits (Pg 54-55)
* 4 key questions to ask yourself when trying to build a good habit (or any habit)
	* How do I make this obvious?
	* How do I make this attractive?
	* How do I make it easy?
	* How do I make it satisfying?
* 4 questions to ask when trying to break a habit
	* How do I make this invisible?
	* How do I make this unattractive?
	* How do I make this difficult?
	* How do I make this unsatisfying?
#### Habits are under the autonomous part of our mind (Pg 60)
* Our brains are built to predict. We are constantly learning from our surroundings and everything around us, even when we’re unable to specifically point out what it is that we’ve learnt 
* The basis of each habit is the ability to identify the right cues which will need a certain response
* What makes habits dangerous is that they are under the control of the automatic mind (system 1) rather than the conscious one and it’s always easy to relapse and fall back into the old patterns when trying to break a habit
#### Habits become almost invisible to us if we do not explicitly pay attention to them (Pg 62)
* With repetition, the cues that spark our habits almost become invisible to us and we do not even take notice of what it is that’s causing a certain behaviour 
	* In order to build new habits, we need to find out the existing ones and identify what triggers them 
	* You need to be aware of what they are before you begin on a journey to improve upon them
#### Pointing and Calling is an effective method of awareness (Pg 62)
* Pointing and calling is an effective method of awareness, also practiced by the Japanese railway 
	* The idea is that when you call something out explicitly, you are engaging your conscious brain to identify what’s going on and hence, being aware of the situation
#### How do we be more mindful of our habits (Pg 64)
* To be more mindful of your habits, you can create a list of all the habits you follow daily (maybe start off with a daily morning routine) and classify them as effective, ineffective and neutral
	* Effective = has a net positive outcome on our life in the long run
	* Ineffective = has a net negative outcome 
	* Neutral = general tasks that don’t need changing 
* Always take a third person’s POV for this, so no judgement creeps in 
* Alternatively, we can also follow Point and Call in lives where each time we want to do something, we call out explicitly what it is and what the outcome is going to be
	* This helps us to be more mindful of our actions instead of falling into the autopilot mode
#### Implementation Intention (Pg 70)
* We are more likely to follow through on actions when we make a clear plan for them. Called *Implementation Intention*, the idea is fairly straightforward -> we are much more likely to follow through on actions when we specify the time and place for the activity we’re planning 
	* It’s basically like planning *“when x arises, I’ll do y”*, but with a time and place (which are two of the strongest cues available to us)
* Many times, we make up resolutions to do something but don’t decide where or when we’ll do it
	* Best example is my writing habit, for which I didn’t set any time or place and it’s one of the least followed through habit of mine
	* On the other hand, I have a specific time and place for reading daily, and I’ve been able to follow through on that habit

#### Habit stacking (Pg 76)
* Habit stacking is a beautiful system of connected habits - a chain of habits - which basically acts in a fairly simple way. The reward from the first habit becomes the cue for the next and so on
	* This is, effectively, what I’m doing with my reading and sitting in the sun, where everyday after I take a dump, I go and sit in the sun with a book
	* The other habit I’ve now stacked is the one of writing a morning journal, which I’m always doing during taking a dump
	* This also allowed me to remove another habit of mindlessly scrolling through social media on the pot

#### Habit stacking also requires you to have specific cues (pg 78)
* Your cues should be at a similar frequency as the new habit you want to stack on top of it
* Like above, you need to be very specific with the stacking cues in order to pick up new habits. 
* An easy way to identify where to stack new habits would be to jot down all your current habits -> everything that you do regularly

#### Our environments have a strong influence on our habits (Pg 82)
* We are bound to habits based on our environments
* When you’re around your friends, you might swear a lot, which does not happen in you’re around your parents or boss
* Similarly, people tend to munch constantly when something is readily available for them to eat (this also has to be something delicious!)

#### We are heavily dependent on our vision (Pg 84)
* While we, as humans, rely on 5 senses and innumerable other non conscious senses, we are heavily reliant on the sense of sight
* We tend to do more of what is directly in our sight of vision - in our environment

### Design your environment for success (Pg 86)
* If you want to regularly do something, make the cues for it obvious and present in your line of sight
* We tend to rarely design our environment and set it up with the right cues, which also makes it much harder to accomplish

#### Context provides cues, as habits solidify (Pg 87)
* As we use an object frequently, we start to associate the context itself with the habit, rather than any specific cue
* We need to think of objects in relation to how we tend to use them - this context is what provides the cues for our brain to trigger habits

#### Assign specific tasks for each object in your surrounding (Pg 89)
* When we mix habits around the same objects and spaces, we tend to mix habits as well
* Assign specific tasks to the different objects and try not to do multiple tasks in the same place in order to rectify habits

#### It’s easier to build new habits in a new environment (pg 90)
* When you are in a new environment, you do not have the old cues pulling you towards habits and this makes it easier to build new habits
* You can assign context for each object / space in this new environment based on the habits you want to develop

#### Self control, without any changes to the environment, is a difficult (and highly short term) task (pg 92)
* When we want to use our will and grit to control our behaviour, we need to be conscious of our every habit and what is triggering them 
* This could, in most cases, end up backfiring and leading us to double down on the same habits that we’re trying to avoid

#### Best way to improve self control is to use it as little as possible (pg 94)
* A better way to use self control would be to design the environment in a way that we have to resist temptation rarely; where these cues are not present around us to trigger habits

#### Our habits stick around for a long long time (Pg 93)
* Habits - good or bad - tend to stick around for a lot longer than we care to acknowledge. Many habits are latent, waiting for the right context and cues to show up again
* This is also similar to the experiment mentioned in The Power of Habit, where Duhigg talks about the guy with the memory issue where he cannot remember anything but is able to walk around the entire street to come back home, without ever realising that’s home

#### To get rid of habits, just invert the first law (of making things obvious) (pg 95)
* Just make everything (habits that you want to get rid of) that you don’t want to do invisible (make the cues invisible or less obvious)
* This is also a beautiful way to apply [[¬ Charlie Munger's Mental Models|Munger's mental models]] Invert, always invert

#### Supernatural stimuli are present in all of our minds (pg 102)
* These stimuli are usually rooted in evolutionary benefits, which causes them to be super autonomous and hard to fight! 

#### While our environment has evolved rapidly over the past centuries - especially the last couple of centuries - our brains are still way behind (Pg 102)
* Our brain has not evolved a lot from the Paleolithic era (it’s a short timeframe for evolution to happen), and still has a lot of the instincts from the hunter-gatherer days of our ancestors
* The food and beverages industry relies on this by trying to trick us (our brains) into consuming more and more of their product
* This is done through rich flavouring, high fats and through research on maintaining a good *orosensation* (or, mouth feel)

#### Companies work heavily towards making things more interesting and attractive than they are / need to be (Pg 104)
* Advertising, celebrity endorsements, sponsored content, YouTube videos - everything works on the principle of showing the product as more interesting than they are
* This deception works miracles on our minds as we tend to be more tempted towards such products

#### Habits are a dopamine driven feedback loop (pg 106)
* All habit forming activities (read addictive) are dependent on a dopamine feedback loop, craving the reward
* While the brain usually gets a reward (dopamine) for doing some action successfully, with habits, this changes a little
* In case of habits, the brain starts to anticipate the outcome of the activity and the dopamine hit is received before the action itself is done
* If this outcome is not inline with the expectation, then there is a drop in the dopamine levels 

#### Dopamine is critical for action (Pg 106)
* Dopamine is associated not just with pleasurable activity but with all activity
* It is central to our motivation, our activity and a drop in dopamine levels usually leads to severe inactivity

#### Our brain is designed to respond to wants
* The *wanting centres* in our brain are about 10x the size of the *liking centres*, which means we are much more likely to do an action due to the craving (anticipation of the result) itself than for the feeling of liking the result / reward

### Fleeting notes
### Why students tend to struggle after going into IITs 
*  This is very evident in the students preparing for the holy Grail of IIT -> because they’re told to work towards this goal, they work extremely hard for it and once they’re in, stop working on it. They’ve only ever worked towards this goal and now that it was achieved, what else was left to do. 

This stems from the [[#Why are systems better than goals Pg 24]]

### What causes the fickle mindedness?
 When I want to stop trying to be fickle minded, it is important to understand what is the belief that is driving this -> is it that if I don’t try new things all the time, I’ll be left behind?

This stems from [[#Behaviours are linked to our beliefs which we hold close to our heart (Pg 32)]]

### Why praise works better than criticism to motivate people
 This is linked to what Dale Carnegie says in How to Win; when we appreciate someone for doing something correctly, their belief that they can do this thing increases and they start following up on the behaviour more and more. This is why it is a very effective tactic. When we criticise them for not doing something correctly, their belief further drops in themselves and they are less likely to improve upon it

This stems from [[#Identity and habits work in a feedback loop  (Pg 37, 38)]]

### Why I tend to watch more YouTube when sitting in a sofa during work hours
* On weekends, I am usually sitting in the sofa and watching stuff as I am working on the side. My brain is associating sitting in a sofa with the habit of watching YouTube/relaxation -> if I change my weekend habit to only relax instead of doing anything on the side, I’d probably be even more cranky when I’m sitting in a sofa during work hours 
* Similarly, when I sit on the chair during weekends, I usually am able to get a lot more writing done and work more seriously as this is a habit that I have during work days 

This stems from [[#Assign specific tasks for each object in your surrounding]]

### Why it was easier for Deven to avoid YouTube and Netflix on his new laptop
When he got his new laptop, he made it a point to avoid using YouTube and Netflix on it so that his brain doesn’t pick up those cues automatically. This helps him avoid wasting time when he wants to focus and get some writing or research done 

This stems from a conversation with [[Deven Mehta]] and [[#It’s easier to build new habits in a new environment]]

### It is harder to use self control constantly as it takes a lot of mental energy & could leave us fatigued 
This is partly from this book and partly based on the experiment outlined in [[¬ Daniel Kahneman - Thinking Fast and Slow (2011)|Thinking Fast and Slow]] where it is noted that it is much harder to exert self control when we need to chain such tasks. So if you’re just done resisting the urge to watch YouTube, grab a smoke and check social media, you’ll probably end up eating something or getting that smoke anyway because your brain is fatigued to fight another urge

This stems from [[#Best way to improve self control is to use it as little as possible]]

### Supernormal stimuli that James mentions are nothing but Fixed action patterns
The click, run pattern described in [[¬ Robert B. Cialdini - Influence (1984)#Fixed Action Patterns |Influence - The Psychology of Persuasion]] are what are described here as Supernormal Stimuli - stimuli which trigger an automatic reaction in us and a lot of animals and birds, these are the preloaded patterns in our brains which dictate our actions when they spot certain cues

This stems from [[#Supernatural stimuli are present in all of our minds (pg 102)]]

### Why Boyle, a foodie, measures Mouth Feel on his pizza blog
* Holt also mentions that Boyle’s is the only blog that measures mouth feel
* This is a very nice detail to throw in there! Given a pizza is supposed to be addictive and also, takes some effort to complete, mouth feel is an important metric for finishing a pizza

This stems from [[#While our environment has evolved rapidly over the past centuries - especially the last couple of centuries - our brains are still way behind (Pg 102)]]

### Environmental change works better than self control when trying to get out of habits

* Once a habit is built, we start experiencing the dopamine hit with the craving itself and not with the reward
* This means that the dopamine high is achieved even before the actual action is performed, increasing our motivation for the action
* So, if we go the way of self control, we are trying to fight off our habit two ways - the automated response AND this additional motivation 
* Instead, with an environment change, we can avoid the craving altogether and that would make it much easier to demonstrate “self control”

This stems from [[#Habits are a dopamine driven feedback loop (pg 106)]], [[#Self control, without any changes to the environment, is a difficult (and highly short term) task (pg 92)]], [[#Dopamine is critical for action (Pg 106)]] and [[#Our brain is designed to respond to wants]]
