### Literature Notes
#### Value proposition of Essentialism
Once we start giving ourselves the [[#Permission to stop trying to do everything]], to say yes to everyone, we can make the highest contribution to things that matter.

#### Doing it all
We are increasingly living in a society where we are motivated to do it all. Anyone not pursuing a lot of paths is not being “productive” and not efficient. They’re not taking advantage of the huge resources suddenly available to them.
This is leading us to pursue paths which we might not entirely be focused on, but doing in order to “try something”

#### Essentialism is about focusing your energy in the right places
The idea behind essentialism is the principle “less but better”. It’s the disciplined pursuit of constantly asking ourselves - [[#am I investing my time and energy in the right place]]?
There are a LOT of activities in the world and not remotely enough time or energy in us to pursue them all. In such a situation, it becomes critical that we are spending our time on the most important activities for us.

#### Get the Right things done
The guiding principle in life should not be to get all things done, as most of the things are trivial and many, useless.
Instead, it should be to get the right things done - the things that have the most value and have the biggest impact

#### If you do not prioritise your life, some one else will
If we do not make the decisions on what is important and what is unimportant for our time, then someone else will make this decision and we will have to live with it.

#### Why do we make the choices we make?
All of us, or at least most of us, know inherently that we should be saying no to certain tasks and avoiding some of the work that we are talked into. Not all meetings need to be attended and similarly, not all requests need to be entertained.
And yet, we spend most of our time attending pointless meetings and handling unimportant requests. This is partly because we are conditioned to say Yes, as a society.
Saying Yes feels good in the moment as it avoids the awkward confrontation, and saying No is usually accompanied by an unpleasant conversation.
However, in the long run, this might not matter as much and would actually have the opposite effect as we are able to deliver better on the right things.

#### The Paradox of success
We usually become successful by doing some specific things very well (which, in a broad sense, is similar to Essentialism).

When we start doing these things well, we become the Go-To for these things and are relied upon more and more for these tasks.
With this success, there is talk about growth and newer “opportunities”, which can be pursued.

As we pursue these newer opportunities, we start spreading ourselves too thin, and are stretching to deliver on all the fronts.

#### Explosion of choices
In the Information Age, the choices available to each of us have exploded these days, which has made it much harder for us to do the trade offs.
For a large part of the human history, the choices available to us have been fairly limited, but now, with this explosion, we are forced to make the difficult trade offs ourselves

#### Immense social pressure is common in today’s hyperconnected world
Social pressure has always been a crucial part of the human existence, and drives a lot of our actions, such as  [[¬ Robert B. Cialdini - Influence (1984)#Social alienation and reciprocation|Influence - The Psychology of Persuasion]]
However, this is now growing at an uncontrollable pace, with the eyes on us at all times on social media, with our choices being influenced by what we see there at all points we’re on it.

#### “Priorities” are really always singular
Etymologically, a priority refers to the first thing that needs to be done. However, over the past 100 years, we’ve started defining multiple “priorities” as we try to do more and more things within a limited time frame.
When there are 5 or 7 priorities defined, nothing is a priority. All of them are just entries on a task list.

#### Making trade offs is central to essentialism
Essentialism does not mean saying no to everything we do not like, haphazardly. Instead, it means that we need to take a hard look at each task and identify what we really need to do - where we can have the most impact.
Sometimes, this might mean passing up on really good opportunities

#### Explore and evaluate the different possible options
Look at each item and ask some tough questions -> do I wear this often? Do I like this?
Ask yourself “how will this task help me in the long run”?
We typically tend to ask much simpler questions when doing this, which often leads to a cluttered, overflowing task list (and wardrobe)

#### Eliminate
Once we’ve done the [[#Explore and Evaluate]]  part, it is important to now discard the rest from our wardrobe, or otherwise, we’ve not made any progress.
The same approach of tough questions comes into play here. We need to understand what needs to be “archived” or put on the back burner and what needs to be removed altogether.
Here, questions such as “if I didn’t own this, how much would I pay to get it” tend to help. This also allows us to overcome the [[#Sunk cost fallacy]]

#### Execute
With a wardrobe, it is important to regularly clean and eliminate any clothes that we no longer use - maybe once a year.
However, with our lives, we need to be a lot more regular, almost every time we are faced with a new “opportunity”, as [[#Opportunities comes with demands on our time and energy]].
Thus, we need to come up with a system - a mental model - which helps us optimise these critical resources and deliver on our goals / expectations.

#### Sunk Cost Fallacy
A sunk cost fallacy is when we continue to invest time or resources or both into a behaviour or endeavour where we’ve already invested heavily.
This is linked to  [[Loss aversion]] and  [[Status quo bias]]

#### Opportunities comes with demands on our time and energy
We need to evaluate each new opportunity with the lens that it will have a certain demand on our time and energy, both of which are limited resources.
We need to understand and optimise these key resources across all existing and new opportunities, in order to balance our efforts and meet the goals.

### Fleeting notes
#### Permission to stop trying to do everything
We need to change our way of thinking when responding to requests and this requires our brain to accept this new way of thinking and approaching social situations. Hence, the “permission” is needed to say no to something, when we are trying to [[#doing it all]]

This stems from [[#Value proposition of Essentialism]] and [[#doing it all]]

#### Am I investing my time and energy in the right place
This is a question we should keep asking ourselves and take the as the North Star in our lives whenever we are at a juncture and have to make a decision on how to invest our time and efforts

This stems from [[#Essentialism is about focusing your energy in the right places]]

#### We could often be pushed into a corner for our choices by our social commitments
We end up committing to things and meetings many times due to a couple reasons - [[#If you do not prioritise your life, some one else will]] and [[¬ Robert B. Cialdini - Influence (1984)#Reciprocation is an overpowering factor]]. Many times, we just commit to things because we know that if we do not, we will probably get shunned from society ([[¬ Robert B. Cialdini - Influence (1984)#Social alienation and reciprocation]]

This stems from [[#Why do we make the choices we make?]], [[¬ Robert B. Cialdini - Influence (1984)#Reciprocation is a strong driving force]], [[#Immense social pressure is common in today’s hyperconnected world]]
