#### What is design thinking
Design thinking is a thinking approach or a problem solving technique which tends to keep the user at the centre of it all. It is not the same as thinking about how to design something (although, that is a part of it, many times)

It can be used to solve for numerous problems all around us.

#### Behavioural changes with design thinking
Design Thinking can be applied for driving a behavioural change - both for good and bad - in products and systems design.
While there is often the “[[#Invisible hand of design]] “ thrown around, that is not really a real thing - if a design causes unintentional behavioural changes, it is just bad design.
The idea of design thinking is to understand what behavioural changes you want to drive, and to design your systems or products in a way that they can lead to these specific outcomes.

#### Invisible hand of design
Invisible hand of design is the concept of design causing unintentional behavioural changes - an example of this is the addiction to social media

#### Management approaches today
A lot of the processes and systems designed and in place today are an outcome of the design done for the industrial era. With the changing times, it is important for us to think afresh for the new problems that surround us, and solve for them individually.
Today, we need a new way of management / a new management technique which is not entirely similar to [[#Problem solving techniques today]]  but also focussed on the end users, and the impact it has on them

#### Problem solving techniques today
Today, the same techniques are applied to solve problems across the globe, without taking into consideration the vast differences between the different cultures, economies and geographies.
While there has been tremendous growth in the technological fields, these are not helping us steer away from the ominous ending that awaits the planet - quite the opposite

#### A new way of approaching management
While it is not advisable to run a business solely considering the emotions and feelings of the employees and customers, it is also not recommended to take a wildly rational approach, and ignore all feelings. Design thinking is an approach which is somewhere in the middle
This is the approach that we should think about as we move ahead, and try to move away from the [[#Management approaches today]]

#### Example of design thinking
A beautiful example of  Design Thinking is demonstrated in the Shimano example, when when trying to solve for the problem of flattening sales, the design thinkers stopped looking at their existing customer base and instead looked at the rest of the market which did not even cycle.
The idea here was to understand why the majority of adults did not cycle, when they used to do it as a favoured activity as kids.
They designed a holistic solution, which actually resulted in a completely new segment of bikers, which was then copied by several other companies

#### Behaviour is never right or wrong - it is always meaningful
* It’s common for us to assume that people should figure out how things work or understand how it is supposed to work
* However, when people are busy on their own tasks, they’d probably want to spend as little time as needed on this and will resort to the behaviour which gets them the work done quickly
* For changing behaviour, we should design our systems such that they keep the user in mind and at the centre of it

#### “Insight” phase of a problem is critical and helps us uncover the problems that we’re trying to solve for
* In the insight phase, we should just observe the behaviours and understand how people are interacting with our products, competitors’ products and everything else
* Do they make use of the products as we intended them or are they doing something else
* This helps us look at the problem from different perspectives and understand how something is actually being used instead of how we want it to be used - gives a good starting point for any future developments

#### Enter the problem solving phase without any prejudice or preconceived notions
* We should try to enter the Insight phase with no judgements and prejudice, as this helps us identify behaviour the way it is instead of trying to justify it with out prejudice

#### Observe what people do and say (and don’t do and don’t say)
* For gathering better insights, it is important to understand how someone is using a particular tool but also how they’re not using it
* Similarly, it is important to understand what they don’t say out loud about the tool and put this subtext to use

#### Outliers are where you should look at for gathering new or interesting insights
* We tend to look at the vast average in our daily analyses in everything - companies look at the “majority of the customers”, and how they’re using the product
* While the average is a very representative set of the customer base in most cases, they rarely bring out new insights; they just validate what we already know
* To uncover new insights, we should look at the extremes of the bell curve - the high percentile users and the low percentile users
* You don’t need to look at your actual customer base to improve your products; it could also be someone who is absolutely outside the customer base but is a good representation of the extreme cases for your product use

####  Behaviour can be observed across 
* In order to understand how an emergency room works, you don’t need to look at a lot of emergency rooms in isolation
* The idea is to breakdown what are the factors which “make an emergency room and emergency room”
	* These would be things like the high pressure and tensions, need for immediate service, a ticking clock
	* Now, you can look at any other situations where the same factors come into play and make observations across the situations to draw insights

#### Empathy is crucial to understand and “feel” how our customers do
* It is important to remember to also think about how the users are feeling when using the product and put ourselves in their shoes when observing
* Design thinking is not about collecting stacks of observations but about solving very real problems 
* We tend to look at our end products from our own eyes and not from the perspective of people who will be using them 

#### We often miss the main point of the customer or user’s pain in using a product or service
* We tend to look at the product or service pretty much from our own perspective or from that of the intention of design
* What we often miss is that the problems that the user might be facing are something completely different
* For example, in an emergency room, while most hospitals might tend to focus on efficiency and speed, the patient might be more worried about where they are, how they might be and what they’ll need to pay for this
* Similarly, in consulting, in analytics, everywhere, we need to understand what is the problem in the first place
	* We could be solving a 100 problems and wondering why the sales are not improving or why the NPS is still low, if we do not solve the main problems that our users face

#### Balance out perspectives of all the different stakeholders when coming up with a solution (Pg 58)
* Usually, we have multiple stakeholders for any product or service that we are designing and it is important to look at how all the different people are using it
* If we try to change the design to be heavily aligned with just one set of users, we might end up hurting the usability for others 
* For example, if the emergency room experience is designed to be too patient friendly, it might end up hurting some professionalism which is needed for the healthcare workers to get on with their job (which is difficult as it is)

#### Latent needs (Pg 58)
* Latent needs are the needs of users which are acute and might be affecting them, but they are unable to articulate
* It is the job of a design thinker to uncover these needs and find a solution for them

#### Getting people emotionally connected to a product or service usually does miracles (Pg 60)
* Product designers might spend a large part of their day figuring out how to make the product more functional but what also matters is the emotional connection they’re able to build between the product and user
* What are the factors that will bind the user to this product?

#### Above individuals, we also need to look at interactions within groups, and interactions of the groups themselves (Pg 62)
* When there are multiple groups of users involved, all of which might use the product differently, it is important to think about how would they use it and if so, how would it change the interactions
* This is especially true for any design involving network - office design, networked thought, social media, and so on

#### Culture plays a big role in any design (Pg 63)
* While the author is referring to cultures through ethnicity, the same holds true for office culture and college cultures as well
* The same product might perform differently in different office settings, depending on the company culture

#### Move away from thinking of individuals as “users” or “customers” (pg 65)
* For implementing a good design thinking solution, we should move away from thinking of the “final user” as just a user and start thinking of them as a collaborator 
* How can we get this individual to help us design our product better or improve it?

> Chance only favours the prepared mind 
\- Louis Pasture, 1854

#### Insight cannot be codified or even defined, many times (Pg 68)
- Insights, especially qualitative research, cannot be codified or automated. In many cases, this can't even be defined properly, which makes it all the more complex and exciting

### Fleeting notes

#### Why the team doesn’t use tableau reports 
* People haven’t yet figured out how to use tableau in the team and they’d much rather use Google Sheets than Tableau because it allows them to do the things that they’d like to do
* If the tableau report is design in a way that it meets their use cases, they’ll probably use it more

This stems from [[#Behaviour is never right or wrong - it is always meaningful]]

#### Balancing complexity and “explainability” is a key component of Data science
* When deciding on DS algorithms, especially in client facing DS work, it is advisable to pick a model which is effective for the problem statement but also can be easily explained. 
* This is important because while we want to arrive at the right results, it is equally important to get the client onboard and it isn’t fair to expect them to understand or believe a black box ML model

This stems from [[#Balance out perspectives of all the different stakeholders when coming up with a solution (Pg 58)]]

#### Why company culture is key to determine the success of new programs
* If a company’s culture is built on stretching for work and on hard work instead of smart work, any number of solutions and meetings to improve work life balance can never come to fruition 
* Similarly, if a company culture is built around the top down approach of leaders first, it is going to be extremely difficult to implement employee friendly solutions in this environment 

This stems from [[#Culture plays a big role in any design (Pg 63)]], [[ƒ Why Shirish hates Slack]] and my own experience with Oyo 

### Why companies are more and more open to launch beta products to the public today
A lot of products today in the note taking space - Mem, Roam, Obsidian - are all in the beta stage and yet, these are products that are already available to the users 

With Mem, they are actively taking feedback from the members of the Slack channel and interacting with them as if they were members of their company. 

This allows them to crowdsource better ideas for the product itself and also build something that is explicitly asked by the final users

They’re also probably getting these people to be emotionally invested in the product itself as they’d be using it since it was in Beta and have contributed to direct features of the product

This stems from [[#Move away from thinking of individuals as “users” or “customers” (pg 65)]] and [[#Getting people emotionally connected to a product or service usually does miracles (Pg 60)]]
